The application provides GPS tracking to track the mechanic and also find the way to reach the userâ€™s location. Similarly, the automobile and mechanic shops register themselves providing their certificates and locations to help us route and connect the user in need of help in and around their area. The time for the mechanic to provide services to the user would not take much time since the user is connected to nearby mechanic and automobile shops by calculating the shortest distance between them.
